First and foremost, I wish to thank my advisor, Tomer Schlank, for the huge amount of patience and time he invested in guiding me through this project.
He has been extremely helpful, both by sharing his deep insights and conceptual understanding, as well as figuring out many details along the way.
I wish to thank Tomer's other students, and especially Lior Yanovski and Shaul Barkan, for giving me new perspectives and helping me comprehend various topics, mainly in chromatic homotopy theory.
They've been great friends, and made this project much more enjoyable.
I also thank Gal Porat, for numerous conversations and explanations, mostly related to elliptic curves and algebraic geometry.
