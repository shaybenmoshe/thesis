\section{HKR Character Theory}

As we have seen in the previous section, Atiyah and Segal gave a description of $\K\left(\BG\right)$ in terms of the representation ring.
We have also seen in the section on chromatic homotopy theory, that complex K-theory is related to Morava K-theory at height 1 by \ref{k-thy-modp-morava}, and to Morava E-theory at height 1 by \ref{k-thy-comp-defo}.
Representations can be studied using their characters, and one may wonder if a similar construction can be used to study higher analogues of complex K-theory evaluated at $\BG$.

Hopkins, Kuhn and Ravenel showed in \cite{HKR} that it is indeed possible.
Their paper contains a lot of results, but we will concentrate on Theorem C.
Fix some finite group $G$.
Similarly to the proof Atiyah-Segal theorem, the actual proof of Theorem C involves a general construction, even to prove the specific case we are interested, but it will be easier to state it first for the specific case.
Let $E = \E{k, \Gamma}$ be the Lubin-Tate spectrum from \ref{lt-spectrum}, for some field $k$ of characteristic $p$, and $\Gamma$ a formal group law over $k$ of height $n$. \todo{they write it specifically for $k = \mbb{F}_{p^n}$, but we don't really need that, right?}
There is some ring $L = L\left(E^*\right)$ (which depends on the spectrum $E$).
It is then possible define some generalized characters $\cl[n,p]{G; L}$, which are completely algebraic and combinatorial (besides the definition of the ring $L$).
Lastly, there is a character map $\chinpG: E^*\left(\BG\right) \to \cl[n,p]{G; L}$.
This character map has similar formal properties to the ordinary character map, namely, similarly to \ref{char-1}, after tensoring with $L$, the character map
$$
\chinpG \otimes L:
E^*\left(\BG\right) \otimes L
\xrightarrow{\sim} \cl[n,p]{G; L}
$$
becomes an isomorphism.
Similarly to \ref{char-2}, there is an action of $\aut\left(\ZZ_p^n\right) \cong \left(\ZZ_p^\times\right)^n$ on $\cl[n,p]{G; L}$, and it turns out that the character map lands in the fixed points.
Moreover, we can merely rationalize, which is given by inverting $p$, the source, rather tensoring with $L$.
It turns out that after rationalization and restricting the codomain to the fixed points, the map becomes an isomorphism, that is
$$
p^{-1} \chinpG:
p^{-1} E^*\left(\BG\right)
\xrightarrow{\sim} \cl[n,p]{G; L}^{\aut\left(\ZZ_p^n\right)}
$$
is an isomorphism.

\todo{write something about the structure of this section}



\subsection{Towards a Definition of the Character Map}

Following \cite{HKR}, we denote by $\Lambda_r = \left(\ZZ/{p^r}\right)^n$ and $\Lambda = \ZZ_p^n$.

An element $g \in G$ is called \emph{$p$-power-torsion} if $g^{p^a} = e$ for some $a$.
Note that a conjugation of a $p$-power-torsion element is again $p$-power-torsion.
We also define $r_0 \in \mbb{N}$ to be the minimal $r$ s.t. every $p$-power-torsion element $g$ is $p^{r_0}$-torsion, i.e. satisfies $g^{p^{r_0}} = e$.

\begin{definition}
	We define $\Gnp$ to be the set of $n$-tuples $\left(g_1, \dotsc, g_n\right)$ of commuting $p$-power-torsion elements.
	It has a $G$-action by conjugation, $\gamma. \left(g_1, \dotsc, g_n\right) = \left(\gamma g_1 \gamma^{-1}, \dotsc, \gamma g_n \gamma^{-1}\right)$.
\end{definition}

Concretely, for $r \geq r_0$, we have $\Gnp = \hom_{\Grp}\left(\Lambda_r, G\right)$, with the $G$-action by conjugation at the values.
In a similar fashion, $\Gnp = \hom_{\TopGrp}\left(\Lambda, G\right)$ (the homomorphisms are required to be continuous).

Let $R$ be a ring.
Equip it with the trivial $G$-action.

\begin{definition}\label{class-function-*}
	The \emph{class functions} are $\cl[n,p]{G; R} = \hom_{\GSet}\left(\Gnp, R\right)$, that is functions from $\Gnp$ to $R$ which are invariant under conjugation.
\end{definition}

This is a ring, by defining the operations point-wise.
Note that this is a purely combinatorial construction, just a copy of $R$ for every orbit of $\Gnp/G$, that is $\cl[n,p]{G; R} \cong \bigoplus_{\left[\alpha\right] \in \Gnp/G} R$.

We would like to construct a character map $E^*\left(\BG\right) \to \cl[n,p]{G; R}$, for some $R$, which depends on $r \geq r_0$.
We will try to unravel what this means, and find appropriate $R$'s at the same time.
By the above, this is a homomorphism $E^*\left(\BG\right) \to \bigoplus_{\left[\alpha\right] \in \Gnp/G} R$.
That is, for every $\left[\alpha\right] \in \Gnp/G$ we need to provide a homomorphism $E^*\left(\BG\right) \to R$.
Choose a representative $\alpha \in \Gnp = \hom_{\Grp}\left(\Lambda_r, G\right)$ (for $r \geq r_0$).
Since $\BB$ is a functor we get $\BB[\alpha]: \BB[\Lambda_r] \to \BG$, and then we can take $E^*$-cohomology to get a homomorphism $\BB[\alpha]^*: E^*\left(\BG\right) \to E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right)$.
If we had a homomorphism $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right) \to R$, we would indeed get a well-defined character map.



\subsection{The \texorpdfstring{$E^*$}{E*}-Cohomology of \texorpdfstring{$\BB[A]$}{BA} and Their Maps}

We postpone the discussion of the rings, to give some properties of $E^*$-cohomology.

First we describe $E^*\left(\BB[\ZZ/m]\right)$.
Let $\psi_m: \ZZ/m \to \UU[1]$ be the homomorphism $\psi\left(1\right) = e^{2\pi i/m}$
This induces $\BB\psi^*: E^*\left(\BU[1]\right) \to E^*\left(\BB[\ZZ/m]\right)$.
Denote by $x \in E^2\left(\BB[\ZZ/m]\right)$ the cohomology class $\BB\psi^*\left(x\right)$.

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[5.8]{HKR}}]
	The $E^*$-cohomology of $\BB[\ZZ/m]$ is given by $E^*\left(\BB[\ZZ/m]\right) = E^*\formal{x} / \left(\left[m\right]\left(x\right)\right)$.
	Write $m = sp^t$ with $a$ coprime to $p$, then this is a free $E^*$-module of rank $p^{nt}$.
\end{proposition}
\todo{I don't understand the proof, try to understand and write here}

\begin{proposition}
	Let $Y$ be a space s.t. $E^*\left(Y\right)$ is a free $E^*$-module of finite rank.
	Then $Y$ satisfies Kunneth with respect to any $X$, that is, the map $E^*\left(X\right) \otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(Y\right) \xrightarrow{\sim} E^*\left(X \times Y\right)$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Look at the functors $X \mapsto E^*\left(X\right) \otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(Y\right)$ and $X \mapsto E^*\left(X \times Y\right)$.
	Both of them are manifestly homotopy invariant.
	Since $E^*\left(Y\right)$ is free, it is also flat, and so both functors satisfy Mayer-Vietoris.
	Both functors send arbitrary wedges to arbitrary products, since tensor with a free finite rank modules commutes with arbitrary products.
	We conclude that they are both cohomology theories.
	Moreover, they agree on $X = *$, and therefore are isomorphic.
\end{proof}

Using both propositions we can bootstrap to arbitrary finite abelian groups.

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[5.8]{HKR}}]\label{E-B-abelian}
	Let $A$ be an abelian group, and write $\left|A\right| = sp^t$ for $s$ coprime to $p$.
	Then $E^*\left(\BB[A]\right)$ is a free $E^*$-module of rank $p^t$, and $\BB[A]$ satisfies Kunneth.
	Specifically, for $A = \ZZ/m_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus \ZZ/m_l$:
	$$
	E^*\left(\BB[\ZZ/m_1] \times \cdots \times \BB[\ZZ/m_l]\right)
	\cong E^*\formal{x_1, \dotsc, x_l}/\left(\left[m_1\right]\left(x_1\right), \dotsc, \left[m_l\right]\left(x_l\right)\right).
	$$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	A finite abelian group is the product of finite cyclic groups.
	Since $\BB$ commutes with products, we can induct on the number of components in the product.
\end{proof}

\todo{make the rest of the subsection more readable... maybe give a coordinate-free statement}

Recall that the formal group law on $E_*$ was defined by taking the $E^*\left(\BB-\right)$ to the multiplication map $\UU[1] \times \UU[1] \to \UU[1]$.
That is, this map induces the map $x \mapsto F\left(y_1, y_2\right) = y_1 +_F y_2$ on the cohomology.

By pre-composing with the diagonal, and doing this for $k$-copies of $\UU[1]$, we see that the multiplication-by-$k$ map $\UU[1] \overset{k}{\to} \UU[1]$ induces the map $E^*\formal{x} \to E^*\formal{y}$ given by $x \mapsto \left[k\right]\left(y\right)$.
Moreover, it follows that $\left[l\right]\left(x\right) \mapsto \left[kl\right]\left(y\right)$.

Therefore, for a map $\bigoplus_{i=1}^t \UU[1] \to \bigoplus_{j=1}^s \UU[1]$, given on the $i,j$-th coordinate by multiplication-by-$k_{ij}$, induces a map
$E^*\formal{x_1, \dotsc, x_s} \to E^*\formal{y_1, \dotsc, y_t}$
given by $x_j \mapsto \sum_F\left[k_{ij}\right]\left(y_i\right)$.
From this it follows that:
\begin{align*}
	\sum_{j,F}\left[l_j\right]\left(x_j\right)
	&\mapsto \sum_{j,F}\left[l_j\right]\left(\sum_{i,F}\left[k_{ij}\right]\left(y_i\right)\right)\\
	&= \sum_{j,F}\sum_{i,F}\left[k_{ij} l_j\right]\left(y_i\right)\\
	&= \sum_{i,F}\left[\sum_j k_{ij} l_j\right]\left(y_i\right)
\end{align*}

Now, let $k: \bigoplus_{i=1}^t \ZZ/m_i \to \bigoplus_{j=1}^s \ZZ/\mu_j$, given on the $i,j$-th coordinate by multiplication-by-$k_{ij}$.
Recall the maps $\psi_m: \ZZ/m \to \UU[1]$ given by $1 \mapsto e^{2\pi i/m}$.
We look at the maps $\bigoplus_{i=1}^t \psi_{m_i}: \bigoplus_{i=1}^t \ZZ/m_i \to \bigoplus_{i=1}^t \UU[1]$, and similarly $\bigoplus_{j=1}^s \psi_{\mu_j}$.
The composition $\left(\bigoplus_{j=1}^s \psi_{\mu_j}\right) \circ k$ is given on the $i,j$-th coordinate by
$
1
\mapsto k_{ij}
\mapsto e^{2\pi ik_{ij}/m_j}
$.
Define a map $k: \bigoplus_{i=1}^t \UU[1] \to \bigoplus_{j=1}^s \UU[1]$, by letting the $i,j$-th coordinate being the multiplication-by-$k_{ij}$ map.
We then get the commutative diagram:
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
	\bigoplus_{i=1}^t \UU[1] \arrow{r}{k} & \bigoplus_{j=1}^s \UU[1] \\
	\bigoplus_{i=1}^t \ZZ/m_i \arrow[hook]{u}{\bigoplus_{i=1}^t \psi_{\mu_i}} \arrow{r}{k} & \bigoplus_{j=1}^s \ZZ/\mu_j \arrow[hook]{u}{\bigoplus_{j=1}^s \psi_{\mu_j}}
\end{tikzcd}
$$
By taking $E^*\left(\BB-\right)$ we get the commutative diagram:
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
	E^*\formal{y_1, \dotsc, y_t} \arrow{d}{} & E^*\formal{x_1, \dotsc, x_s} \arrow{d}{} \arrow{l}{} \\
	E^*\formal{y_1, \dotsc, y_t}/\left(\left[m_i\right]\left(y_i\right)\right) & E^*\formal{x_1, \dotsc, x_s}/\left(\left[\mu_j\right]\left(x_j\right)\right) \arrow{l}{}
\end{tikzcd}
$$
Where the vertical maps are given by $y_i \mapsto y_i$ and $x_j \mapsto x_j$.
We have computed the upper map before, so we conclude:

\begin{proposition}\label{E-B-map-cyclic}
	Let $k: \bigoplus_{i=1}^t \ZZ/m_i \to \bigoplus_{j=1}^s \ZZ/\mu_j$ be given on the $i,j$-th coordinate by multiplication-by-$k_{ij}$.
	After taking $E^*\left(\BB-\right)$, it induces the map given by $x_j \mapsto \sum_F\left[k_{ij}\right]\left(y_i\right)$.
	Moreover, for integers $l_1, \dotsc, l_s$, it gives $\sum_{j,F}\left[l_j\right]\left(x_j\right) \mapsto \sum_{i,F}\left[\sum_j k_{ij} l_j\right]\left(y_i\right)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
	Note that the $k_{ij}$'s are determined only modulo $\ZZ/\mu_j$, and the proposition implies that the value is independent of the their lifts to $\ZZ$.
	\todo{is that true?}
\end{remark}



\subsection{The Rings \texorpdfstring{$L_r\left(E^*\right)$}{Lr(E*)} and \texorpdfstring{$L\left(E^*\right)$}{L(E*)}}

As we have seen, to construct the character map we needed a ring $R$ together with homomorphisms $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right) \to R$.
We will construct such a ring, $L_r = L_r\left(E^*\right)$.
Moreover, we will take a colimit to construct a ring $L = L\left(E^*\right)$, which contains the information from all of those together.

Recall that $E^*\left(\BU[1]\right) = E^*\formal{x}$, where $x$ is the complex orientation.
For any homomorphism $\alpha: \Lambda_r \to \UU[1]$, we can take $E^*\left(\BB-\right)$ to get $\BB[\alpha]^*: E^*\left(\UU[1]\right) \to E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right)$.
Let $S_r = \left\{ \BB[\alpha]^*\left(x\right) \mid \alpha: \Lambda_r \to \UU[1], \alpha \neq 1 \right\} \subseteq E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right)$.

\begin{definition}
	We define $L_r = S_r^{-1} E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right)$.
	There is indeed a map $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right) \to L_r$, namely the localization map.
\end{definition}

We wish to describe the above construction with coordinates, to make it more explicit.
Recall that $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right) \cong E^*\formal{x_1, \dotsc, x_n}/\left(\left[p^r\right]\left(x_1\right), \dotsc, \left[p^r\right]\left(x_n\right)\right)$ by \ref{E-B-abelian}.
Let $\Lambda_r \overset{\alpha}{\to} S^1$ be a homomorphism.
Since it lands in the $p^r$-torsion, it factors as $\Lambda_r \overset{k}{\to} \ZZ/{p^r} \overset{\psi_{p^r}}{\to} \UU[1]$, where $k$ is given on the $i$-th coordinate by multiplication-by-$k_i$.
The condition $\alpha \neq 1$ amounts to the condition $\left(k_1, \dotsc, k_n\right) \neq 0$.
By \ref{E-B-map-cyclic}, the induced map is given by $\BB[\alpha]^*\left(x\right) = \sum_F [k_i]\left(x_i\right)$.
Therefore $S_r = \left\{ \sum_F [k_i]\left(x_i\right) \mid \left(k_1, \dotsc, k_n\right) \neq 0\right\}$.

\begin{proposition}
	The map $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right) \to E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_{r+1}]\right)$ induced by the projection $\Lambda_{r+1} \to \Lambda_r$, lifts to a map $L_r \to L_{r+1}$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	The projection $\Lambda_{r+1} \to \Lambda_r$ is given by the multiplication-by-$1$ on each coordinate, so again by \ref{E-B-map-cyclic} they induce the maps $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right) \to E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_{r+1}]\right)$, given by $x_i \mapsto x_i$.
	Moreover $\sum_F [k_i]\left(x_i\right) \in S^r$ is mapped to $\sum_F [k_i]\left(x_i\right) \in S^{r+1}$.
	Therefore, once we localize the target, the map lifts to the localization of the source.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	We define $L = L\left(E^*\right) = \colim L_r$.
\end{definition}

Clearly $\aut\left(\Lambda_r\right)$ acts on $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right)$, by its action on $\Lambda_r$ and functoriality.

\begin{proposition}
	The $\aut\left(\Lambda_r\right)$-action lifts to an action on $L_r$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Let $k: \Lambda_r \to \Lambda_r$ be an automorphism given by on the $i,j$-th coordinate by multiplication by $k_{ij}$.
	Once again, by \ref{E-B-map-cyclic}, for integers $l_1, \dotsc, l_n$, the induced map sends $\sum_{j,F} [l_j]\left(x_j\right)$ to $\sum_{i,F}\left[\sum_j k_{ij} l_j\right]\left(x_i\right)$.
	Since $k$ is an automorphism, the matrix $\left(k_{ij}\right)$ is invertible.
	Therefore, if $\left(l_1, \dotsc, l_n\right) \neq 0$, then also $\left(\sum_j k_{1j} l_j, \dotsc, \sum_j k_{1j} l_j\right) \neq 0$, so if the source is in $S^r$, the result is in $S^r$ as well.
	This shows that action lifts to an action on $L_r$.
\end{proof}

\todo{Don't forget to correct the thesis... I used $\sum$ rather than $\sum_F$.}


Using the projection $\pi_r: \aut\left(\Lambda\right) \to \aut\left(\Lambda_r\right)$ we endow $L_r$ with a $\aut\left(\Lambda\right)$-action.
By factoring the projection through $\aut\left(\Lambda_{r+1}\right)$, we see that the map $L_r \to L_{r+1}$ is equivariant with respect to that action.
In conclusion:

\begin{proposition}
	The rings $L_r$ have an $\aut\left(\Lambda\right)$-action, and the maps $L_r \to L_{r+1}$ are equivariant with respect to this action.
	Therefore $L$ has an $\aut\left(\Lambda\right)$-action as well.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
	Let $S \leq \aut\left(\Lambda_r\right)$ be a subgroup.
	Then, the induced map on fixed points $L_r^S \xrightarrow{\sim} L^{\pi_r^{-1}\left(S\right)}$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proposition}

\todo{Is that true? If it is, prove...}



\subsection{The Generalized Class Functions Ring}

As in the case of Atiyah-Segal, in order to establish Theorem C, that is, the result on the character map described in the introduction to this section, we need to formulate a more general theorem.
The theorem will also depend on a $G$-space $X$, and the proof will use this freedom in a crucial way.
Moreover, the proof will rely on passing to other subgroups as well, although unlike in Atiyah-Segal's proof, it will only use abelian subgroups of $G$.
To this end, we define the generalized objects we need.

Let $X$ be a finite $G$-CW complex.
Recall that $r \geq r_0$, we have $\Gnp = \hom_{\Grp}\left(\Lambda_r, G\right)$, with the $G$-action by conjugation.
Note that for $\alpha \in \Gnp$, $X^{\im \alpha}$ is simply the fixed points of $X$ at the $n$-tuple $\left(g_1, \dotsc, g_n\right)$ represented by $\alpha$, so the following is independent of $r \geq r_0$.

\begin{definition}
	The \emph{fixed point space} of $X$ is $\Fix{G,X} = \coprod_{\alpha \in \Gnp} X^{\im \alpha}$.
	This space has a $G \times \aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$-action, described below.
\end{definition}

$\Fix{G,X}$ admits a $G$-action, where $\gamma \in G$ sends $x \in X^{\im \alpha}$ to $\gamma x \in X^{\im \gamma.\alpha}$.
This is well defined, since $x$ fixed by $\alpha$, means that $g_i x = x$, which implies that $\gamma g_i \gamma^{-1} \gamma x = \gamma x$, so that $\gamma x$ is fixed by $\gamma. \alpha$.
Moreover, it admits an $\aut\left(\Lambda_r\right)$-action.
Let $\varphi \in \aut\left(\Lambda_r\right)$, for any $\alpha \in \Gnp$, clearly $\im \alpha = \im \left(\alpha\circ\varphi\right)$, so $x \in X^{\im \alpha}$ is mapped by $\varphi$ to $x \in X^{\im \left(\alpha\circ\varphi\right)}$.
Since $G$ acts on $\alpha$ on the target, and $\varphi$ acts on the source, the actions commute, therefore we have a $G \times \aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$-action.

The action on $\Fix{G,X}$ gives a $G \times \aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$-action of $E^*$-algebras on $E^*\left(\Fix{G,X}\right)$.
As we saw, $L_r$ admits an $\aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$-action, define the trivial $G$-action on it, to get a $G \times \aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$-action.
Take the diagonal $G \times \aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$-action on $L_r \otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(\Fix{G,X}\right)$.
\todo{we probably need op action somewhere}.

\begin{definition}
	The \emph{class functions} are:
	$$
	\cl[n,p]{G,X; L_r}
	= \left(L_r \otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(\Fix{G,X}\right)\right)^G
	$$
	This $E^*$-algebra still has an $\aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$-action.
\end{definition}

Note that for $X = *$, trivial $G$-space, $\Fix{G,*} = \Gnp$ as a $G$-space.
Hence $E^*\left(\Fix{G,*}\right) \cong \hom_{\Set}\left(\Gnp, E^*\right)$.
Taking the $G$ fixed points clearly gives $\hom_{\GSet}\left(\Gnp, E^*\right)$.
In conclusion, we get $\cl[n,p]{G,*; L_r} =  \hom_{\GSet}\left(\Gnp, L_r\right)$.
Note that this agrees with our previous definition \ref{class-function-*}.

We give an alternative description of the algebra before taking the $G$ fixed points.
Simply by taking the coproduct out of the cohomology as a product, and out of the tensor product, we get:

\begin{proposition}\label{Lr-Fix}
	$
	L_r \otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(\Fix{G,X}\right)
	\cong \prod_{\alpha \in \Gnp} \left(L_r \otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(X^{\im \alpha}\right)\right)
	$.
\end{proposition}

We wish to emphasize the combinatorial nature of the $G \times \aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$-action.
To that end, we first formulate a general combinatorial statement:

\begin{proposition}\label{combinatorial-situation}
	Let $H$ be a group.
	Let $I$ be some indexing $H$-set, and let $Y_{\left[i\right]}$ be a collection of $H$-spaces, i.e. indexed by $I/H$.
	Endow $\prod_{i \in I} Y_{\left[i\right]}$ an $H$-action by
	$
	h.\left(y_i\right)_{i \in I}
	= \left(h.y_{h.i}\right)_{i \in I}
	$.
	Then
	$
	\left(\prod_{i \in I} Y_{\left[i\right]}\right)^H
	\cong \prod_{\left[i\right] \in I/H} Y_{\left[i\right]}^{\stab_H\left(i\right)}
	$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	First, the action is indeed well defined since $y_{h.i} \in Y_{\left[i\right]}$, for $i$ and $h.i$ are in the same orbit.
	Requiring that $\left(y_i\right)_{i \in I}$ is a fixed point amounts to $y_i = h.y_{h.i}$.
	Note that this condition equates $y_i$ only with values which are in the $H$-orbit of $i$.
	Moreover, the value of $y_i$ determines the whole $H$-orbit $y_{h.i}$ (by $h^{-1} y_i$).
	Taking those values for the whole orbit, reduces the condition to $y_i = h. y_i$ when $h.i = i$, i.e. when $h$ is in the stabilizer $\stab_H\left(i\right)$.
	Therefore, the condition is simply that $y_i \in Y_{\left[i\right]}^{\stab_H\left(i\right)}$, so the conclusion follows.
\end{proof}

We now want to apply this to our case.

\begin{proposition}\label{combinatorial-cl-fixed}
	We have:
	\begin{multline*}
		\cl[n,p]{G,X; L_r}^{\aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)}\\
		\cong \prod_{\left[\alpha\right] \in \Gnp/{\left(G \times \aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)\right)}}
		\left(
		L_r^{\stab_{\aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)}\left(\alpha\right)}
		\otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(X^{\im \alpha}\right)^{\stab_G\left(\alpha\right)}
		\right)
	\end{multline*}
	In particular, when $X = *$, we have:
	$$
	\cl[n,p]{G; L_r}^{\aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)}
	\cong \prod_{\left[\alpha\right] \in \Gnp/{\left(G \times \aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)\right)}}
	L_r^{\stab_{\aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)}\left(\alpha\right)}
	$$
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	We will take $G \times \aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$ fixed points of \ref{Lr-Fix} in two steps, first by $G$ then by $\aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$.
	Recall that $L_r$ is fixed by $G$.
	The action on the cohomology part comes from the action on the space, taking $x \in X^{\im \alpha}$ to $\gamma x \in X^{\im \gamma.\alpha}$.
	Since this is invertible, this gives a homeomorphism between $X^{\im \alpha}$ and $X^{\im \gamma.\alpha}$, which shows that $E^*\left(X^{\im \alpha}\right) \cong E^*\left(X^{\im \gamma.\alpha}\right)$.
	Using this isomorphism, we indeed see that $E^*\left(X^{\im \alpha}\right)$ depends only on the $G$-orbit of $\alpha$.
	By using \ref{combinatorial-situation} for \ref{Lr-Fix}, we get:
	$$
	\cl[n,p]{G,X; L_r}
	\cong \prod_{\left[\alpha\right] \in \Gnp/G} \left(L_r \otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(X^{\im \alpha}\right)^{\stab_G\left(\alpha\right)}\right)
	$$
	We now have the $\aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$-action.
	Recall that $\aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$ didn't act on the space part, since it fixes $\im \alpha$.
	We are then in the situation of \ref{combinatorial-situation} again, and the conclusion follows for the general case.
	Note that when $X = *$, the trivial $G$-space, all fixed points $X^{\im \alpha}$ are again trivial, which shows that the $E^*$-cohomology is simply $E^*$, and tensoring with it does nothing, and the conclusion for the specific case follows.
\end{proof}



\subsection{The General Character Map}

We now construct the character map, that also depends on $r$, which is omitted from the notation:
$$\chinpG: E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \to \cl[n,p]{G,X; L_r}$$
This map is given by a map $E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \to L_r \otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(\Fix{G,X}\right)$ which lands in the $G$ fixed points.
By \ref{Lr-Fix}, this is the data of a map $E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \to L_r \otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(X^{\im \alpha}\right)$ for each $\alpha \in \Gnp$.

Let $\alpha \in \Gnp$, that is $\alpha: \Lambda_r \to G$.
By functoriality of $\EE$, this induces a map $\EE[\Lambda_r] \to \EG$.
Consider the inclusion $X^{\im \alpha} \to X$.
The multiplication of these maps gives $\EE[\Lambda_r] \times X^{\im \alpha} \to \EG \times X$.
Since $X$ and $\EG$ have a $G$-action, the map $\alpha: \Lambda_r \to G$ induces a $\Lambda_r$-action.
Moreover, this $\Lambda_r$-action restricts to a trivial on $X^{\im \alpha}$.
We equip both sides with the diagonal $\Lambda_r$-action, which makes the map equivariant.
The $\Lambda_r$ orbits of the source are $\BB[\Lambda_r] \times X^{\im \alpha}$.
We get a map between the $\Lambda_r$ orbits, and since the action on the target was pulled form the diagonal $G$-action, we can further take the $G$ orbits on the target, to get a map $\BB[\Lambda_r] \times X^{\im \alpha} \to \EG \times_G X$.

Taking $E^*$-cohomology we get $E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \to E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r] \times X^{\im \alpha}\right)$.
Since $X$ was assumed to be a finite $G$-CW complex, we have Kunneth for the target by \ref{E-B-abelian}, so the map is equivalently a map $E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \to E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right) \otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(X^{\im \alpha}\right)$.
Using the localization $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right) \to L_r$ we finally get the desired map $E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \to L_r \otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(X^{\im \alpha}\right)$.
This concludes the construction of the character map.

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[6.9]{HKR}}]
	The map $E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \to L_r \otimes_{E^*} E^*\left(\Fix{G,X}\right)$ constructed above lands in the $G \times \aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$ fixed points.
\end{proposition}

Therefore, by taking the $G$ fixed points on the target, we indeed get the desired character map $\chinpG: E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \to \cl[n,p]{G,X; L_r}$, which lands in the $\aut \left(\Lambda_r\right)$ fixed points.

\begin{proposition}
	The character maps are compatible with the maps $\cl[n,p]{G,X; L_r} \to \cl[n,p]{G,X; L_{r+1}}$, coming from the maps $L_r \to L_{r+1}$.
	Therefore, we have a character map for $L$, that is $\chinpG: E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \to \cl[n,p]{G,X; L}$, which lands in the $\aut \left(\Lambda\right)$ fixed points.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	We constructed the character map by constructing a map for each $\alpha$.
	It is easy to see that these maps are compatible with the maps $L_r \to L_{r+1}$, coming from the projections.
\end{proof}

\todo{write something about $p$ being invertible in $L_r$, $L$}
Since $p$ is invertible in $L$, and $\aut \left(\Lambda\right)$ doesn't change $p^{-1}$, it also follows that after inverting $p$, that is, rationalizing, the map $p^{-1} \chinpG: p^{-1} E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \to \cl[n,p]{G,X; L}$ still lands in the $\aut \left(\Lambda\right)$ fixed points.
(The same is true for $L_r$ in place for $L$.)

We are now in position to state the main theorem.
This should remind you of \ref{char-1} and \ref{char-2}.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[Theorem C]{HKR}}]\label{theorem-c}
	First, $L^{\aut \left(\Lambda\right)} = p^{-1} E^*$, and $L$ is faithfully flat over it.
	Secondly, After tensoring with $L$, the character map
	$\chinpG \otimes L: E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \otimes_{E^*} L \xrightarrow{\sim} \cl[n,p]{G,X; L}$
	becomes an isomorphism.
	Thirdly, the map
	$p^{-1}\chinpG: p^{-1} E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \xrightarrow{\sim} \cl[n,p]{G,X; L}^{\aut \left(\Lambda\right)}$
	is an isomorphism.
\end{theorem}

We will not prove the first part, this is \cite[6.8]{HKR}, see also \cite[6.5]{HKR}.
The second be will proven later.

\begin{proof}[Proof (of the third part)]
	Look at the isomorphism from the second part,
	$E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \otimes_{E^*} L \xrightarrow{\sim} \cl[n,p]{G,X; L}$.
	Endowing the source with $\aut \left(\Lambda\right)$-action by acting only on $L$, makes it equivariant.
	Therefore, there is an isomorphism on the fixed points.
	Using $L^{\aut \left(\Lambda\right)} = p^{-1} E^*$, the fixed points on the source are:
	\begin{align*}
		\left(E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \otimes_{E^*} L\right)^{\aut \left(\Lambda\right)}
		&= E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \otimes_{E^*} L^{\aut \left(\Lambda\right)}\\
		&= E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \otimes_{E^*} p^{-1} E^*\\
		&= p^{-1} E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right)
	\end{align*}
	So indeed $p^{-1} E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \xrightarrow{\sim} \cl[n,p]{G,X; L}^{\aut \left(\Lambda\right)}$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proof}



\subsection{The Idea of the Proof and Complex Oriented Descent}

Our next goal is to proof the second part of \ref{theorem-c}.
That is, for a finite group $G$ and a finite $G$-CW complex $X$, the character map becomes an isomorphism after tensoring with $L$, i.e.
$\chinpG \otimes L: E^*\left(\EG \times_G X\right) \otimes_{E^*} L \xrightarrow{\sim} \cl[n,p]{G,X; L}$
is an isomorphism.
One may wonder why we had to introduce the $G$-space $X$ into the construction, in order to prove the case of interest, $X = *$.
The reason is, that there is a trick, called \emph{complex oriented descent}, that allows us to reduce to the of $G$-spaces $X$ with \emph{abelian stabilizers}.
Using this and some further ideas we reduce to the case where $G$ is abelian, and $X = *$.
That is, introducing the space $X$ into the construction, allows us to reduce the statement to abelian groups.

To be more explicit, this is the strategy.
We will consider the character map as a natural transformation between functors of pairs $\left(G, X\right)$, and then we will follow these steps:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Use complex oriented descent to reduce to $X$ with abelian stabilizers,
	\item Use Mayer-Vietoris to reduce to spaces $X = D^n \times G/A$ with $A$ abelian,
	\item Use homotopy invariance to reduce to $X = G/A$,
	\item Use induction to reduce from $\left(G, G/A\right)$ to $\left(A, *\right)$,
	\item Prove for $\left(A, *\right)$.
\end{itemize}

This strategy will be formulated as a theorem later, after we introduce complex oriented descent.
To introduce it, we need some definitions.

\begin{definition}
	Let $\xi$ be a $d$-dimensional complex vector bundle over a space $X$.
	The \emph{flag bundle} $F\left(\xi\right) \to X$ is the bundle of complete flags in $\xi$.
\end{definition}

The fiber over a point can be described as an (ordered) $d$-tuple $\left(\ell_1, \dotsc, \ell_d\right)$ of orthogonal lines.
To define it precisely, we can take the $d$-fold power of the projective bundle $P\left(\xi\right)$, and restrict to the sub-bundle of orthogonal lines.
We note that for a trivial bundle $X \times V \to X$, we have $F\left(X \times V\right) \cong X \times F\left(V\right)$, i.e. the flags are computed fiber-wise.

\begin{definition}
	Let $C^*: \Spaces^\op \to \GrAb$ be a contra-variant functor from spaces to graded abelian groups.
	$C^*$ is said to satisfy \emph{complex oriented descent},
	if for every space $X$ and bundle $\xi$ over $X$, the diagram
	$X \leftarrow F\left(\xi\right) \leftleftarrows F\left(\xi\right) \times_X F\left(\xi\right)$,
	is sent to an equalizer
	$C^*\left(X\right) \to C^*\left(F\left(\xi\right)\right) \rightrightarrows C^*\left(F\left(\xi\right) \times_X F\left(\xi\right)\right)$.
\end{definition}

We note that if $\xi$ is a $G$-vector bundle over the $G$-space $X$, then $F\left(\xi\right) \to X$ is also a $G$-bundle, since $G$ acts unitarily.
We also recall that every finite group $G$ has a faithful finite dimensional complex representation.
The reason complex oriented descent is useful is the following.

\begin{proposition}\label{faithful-triv-bundle}
	Let $X$ be a $G$-space, and let $\rho: G \to V$ be a faithful representations.
	Then the $G$-space $F\left(X \times V\right) \cong X \times F\left(V\right)$ has abelian stabilizer.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\left(x, \left(\ell_i\right)\right)$ be a point in $X \times F\left(V\right)$.
	We wish to show that its stabilizer is abelian.
	Let $g,h \in G$ be two elements which fix the point, that is, $g.x = x = h.x$ and $\rho_g\left(\ell_i\right) = \ell_i = \rho_h\left(\ell_i\right)$.
	We see that the linear transformations $\rho_g: V \to V$ and $\rho_h: V \to V$ are simultaneously diagonalizable w.r.t to the decomposition $\left(\ell_i\right)$ of $V$.
	Therefore, by a classical result in linear algebra, they commute, $\rho_g \rho_h = \rho_h \rho_g$, i.e. $\rho_{gh} = \rho_{hg}$.
	Since $\rho$ is faithful, we get that $gh = hg$.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	Let $\mcl{C}$ be the category whose objects are pairs $\left(G, X\right)$ where $G$ is a finite group and $X$ is a finite $G$-CW complex.
	The morphisms in $\mcl{C}$ are generated from the following:
	First, the usual morphisms $\left(G, X\right) \to \left(G, Y\right)$.
	Secondly, for $H < G$ and $Y$, we add a morphism $\left(H, Y\right) \to \left(G, G \times_H Y\right)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	Let $C^*: \mcl{C}^\op \to \GrAb$, be a contra-variant functor.
	We define the following properties of $C^*$:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Homotopy invariance} - $C^*\left(G, -\right)$ is $G$-homotopy invariant, for every $G$.
		\item \emph{Mayer-Vietories} - $C^*\left(G, -\right)$ satisfies Mayer-Vietories, for every $G$.
		\item \emph{Complex oriented descent} - $C^*\left(G, -\right)$ satisfies complex oriented descent, for every $G$.
		\item \emph{Induction} - for every, $H < G$ and $H$-space $Y$, the morphism $\left(H, Y\right) \to \left(G, G \times_H Y\right)$ induces an isomorphism $C^*\left(G, G \times_H Y\right) \xrightarrow{\sim} C^*\left(H, Y\right)$. $G$.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
	Let $C^*, D^*: \mcl{C}^\op \to \GrAb$ be functors satisfying the above properties.
	Let $\tau: C^* \to D^*$ be a natural transformation between them.
	Suppose that $\tau$ commutes with connecting morphisms of Mayer-Vietories, and that $\tau\left(A, *\right)$ is an isomorphism for all abelian groups $A$.
	Then $\tau$ is a natural isomorphism.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	We will follow the steps of the strategy outlined before (although we will describe it in the opposite order).
	
	Let $G$ be a group, and $A \leq G$ an abelian subgroup.
	The morphism $\left(A, *\right) \to \left(G, G \times_A *\right) \cong \left(G, G/A\right)$, by naturality of $\tau$, induces a commutative square:
	$$
	\begin{tikzcd}
		C^*\left(G, G/A\right) \arrow{r}{} \arrow{d}{\tau\left(G, G/A\right)} & C^*\left(A, *\right) \arrow{d}{\tau\left(A, *\right)} \\
		D^*\left(G, G/A\right) \arrow{r}{} & D^*\left(A, *\right)
	\end{tikzcd}
	$$
	By induction, the horizontal morphisms are isomorphisms.
	By assumption, $\tau\left(A, *\right)$ is an isomorphism.
	We conclude that $\tau\left(G, G/A\right)$ is an isomorphism.
	
	Since $C^*, D^*$ are homotopy invariant, for every disk $D^n$ equipped with a trivial action, the map $\left(G, G/A \times D^n\right) \to \left(G, G/A\right)$ induces an isomorphism.
	Similarly to before, by naturality $\tau\left(G, G/A \times D^n\right)$ is an isomorphism.
	
	Now, let $X$ a finite $G$-CW complex, s.t. the stabilizer of every point is abelian.
	All the cells are then of the form $G/A \times D^n$ for some abelian subgroup $A \leq G$ and disk $D^n$.
	By an induction on the number of cells, using Mayer-Vietories and the fact that $\tau$ commutes with the connecting morphisms, $\left(G, X\right)$ is an isomorphism.
	
	Lastly, let $X$ be an arbitrary finite $G$-CW complex.
	Let $V$ be a faithful $G$ representation, and consider the bundle $X \times V \to V$.
	By naturality, the diagram $X \leftarrow X \times F\left(V\right) \leftleftarrows X \times F\left(V\right) \times F\left(V\right)$ induces a commutative diagram:
	$$
	\begin{tikzcd}
		C^*\left(X\right) \arrow{r}{f} \arrow{d}{\alpha = \tau\left(G, X\right)}
		& C^*\left(X \times F\left(V\right)\right) \arrow{r}{} \arrow[shift left]{r}{} \arrow{d}{\beta = \tau\left(G, X \times F\left(V\right)\right)}
		& C^*\left(X \times F\left(V\right) \times F\left(V\right)\right) \arrow{d}{\tau\left(G, X \times F\left(V\right) \times F\left(V\right)\right)}
		\\
		D^*\left(X\right) \arrow{r}{g}
		& D^*\left(X \times F\left(V\right)\right) \arrow{r}{} \arrow[shift left]{r}{}
		& D^*\left(X \times F\left(V\right) \times F\left(V\right)\right)
	\end{tikzcd}
	$$
	By complex oriented descent, the two rows are equalizer diagrams.
	By \ref{faithful-triv-bundle}, $X \times F\left(V\right)$ has abelian stabilizers, hence we already know that $\beta = \tau\left(G, X \times F\left(V\right)\right)$ is an isomorphism.
	We can then construct the a map $\beta^{-1} g: D^*\left(X\right) \to C^*\left(X \times F\left(V\right)\right)$ making the diagram commute.
	By the universal property of the equalizer, we get a map $\alpha': D^*\left(X\right) \to C^*\left(X\right)$ s.t. the diagram is commutative.
	The composition $\alpha' \alpha: C^*\left(X\right) \to C^*\left(X\right)$ makes the diagram commute, and since $C^*\left(X\right)$ is the equalizer, by uniqueness, $\alpha' \alpha = \id_{C^*\left(X\right)}$.
	Similarly $\alpha \alpha': D^*\left(X\right) \to D^*\left(X\right)$ makes the diagram commute, so $\alpha \alpha' = \id_{D^*\left(X\right)}$.
	This shows that $\alpha = \tau\left(G, X\right)$, which completes the proof.
\end{proof}
