\section{HKR Character Theory}

As we have seen in the previous section, Atiyah and Segal gave a description of $\K\left(\BG\right)$ in terms of the representation ring.
We have also seen in the section on chromatic homotopy theory, that complex K-theory is related to Morava K-theory at height 1 by \ref{k-thy-modp-morava}, and to Morava E-theory at height 1 by \ref{k-thy-comp-defo}.
Representations can be studied using their characters, and one may wonder if a similar construction can be used to studied higher analogues of complex K-theory evaluated at $\BG$.

Hopkins, Kuhn and Ravenel showed in \cite{HKR} that it is indeed possible.
Their paper contains a lot of results, but we will concentrate on theorem C.
Fix some finite group $G$.
Similarly to the proof Atiyah-Segal theorem, the actual proof of theorem C involves a general construction, even to prove the specific case we are interested, but it will be easier to state it first for the specific case.
Let $E = \E{k, \Gamma}$ be the Lubin-Tate spectrum from \ref{lt-spectrum}, for some field $k$ of characteristic $p$, and $\Gamma$ a formal group law over $k$ of height $n$. \todo{they write it specifically for $k = \mbb{F}_{p^n}$, but we don't really need that, right?}
There is some ring $L = L\left(E^*\right)$ (which depends on the spectrum $E$).
It is then possible define some generalized characters $\cl[n,p]{G, L}$, which are completely algebraic and combinatorial (besides the definition of the ring $L$).
Lastly, there is a character map $\chinpG: E^*\left(\BG\right) \to \cl[n,p]{G, L}$.
This character map has similar formal properties to the ordinary character map, namely, similarly to \ref{char-1}, after tensoring with $L$, the character map
$$
\chinpG \otimes L:
E^*\left(\BG\right) \otimes L
\to \cl[n,p]{G, L}
$$
becomes an isomorphism.
Moreover, similarly to \ref{char-2}, we can merely rationalize, which is given by inverting $p$, the source, rather tensoring with $L$.
There is an action of $\aut\left(\ZZ_p^n\right) \cong \left(\ZZ_p^\times\right)^n$ on $\cl[n,p]{G, L}$, and it turns out that after rationalization the map lands in the fixed points and becomes an isomorphism, that is,
$$
p^{-1} \chinpG:
p^{-1} E^*\left(\BG\right)
\to \cl[n,p]{G, L}^{\aut\left(\ZZ_p^n\right)}
$$
is an isomorphism.

\todo{write something about the structure of this section}



\subsection{The Specific Case}
\todo{better title}

An element $g \in G$ is $p$-power-torsion if $g^{p^a} = e$ for some $a$.
Note that a conjugation of a $p$-power-torsion element is again $p$-power-torsion.
Consider the set $\Gnp$ of $n$-tuples $\left(g_1, \dotsc, g_n\right)$ of commuting $p$-power-torsion elements.
This set has an action of $G$ by conjugating all the elements in a tuple by the same element, i.e. $\gamma \in G$ acts by $\gamma. \left(g_1, \dotsc, g_n\right) = \left(\gamma^-1 g_1 \gamma, \dotsc, \gamma^-1 g_n \gamma\right)$.
Concretely, for $r$ s.t. every $g \in G$ which is $p$-power-torsion
