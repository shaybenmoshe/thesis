\section{HKR Character Theory}

As we have seen in the previous section, Atiyah and Segal gave a description of $\K\left(\BG\right)$ in terms of the representation ring.
We have also seen in the section on chromatic homotopy theory, that complex K-theory is related to Morava K-theory at height 1 by \ref{k-thy-modp-morava}, and to Morava E-theory at height 1 by \ref{k-thy-comp-defo}.
Representations can be studied using their characters, and one may wonder if a similar construction can be used to study higher analogues of complex K-theory evaluated at $\BG$.

Hopkins, Kuhn and Ravenel showed in \cite{HKR} that it is indeed possible.
Their paper contains a lot of results, but we will concentrate on theorem C.
Fix some finite group $G$.
Similarly to the proof Atiyah-Segal theorem, the actual proof of theorem C involves a general construction, even to prove the specific case we are interested, but it will be easier to state it first for the specific case.
Let $E = \E{k, \Gamma}$ be the Lubin-Tate spectrum from \ref{lt-spectrum}, for some field $k$ of characteristic $p$, and $\Gamma$ a formal group law over $k$ of height $n$. \todo{they write it specifically for $k = \mbb{F}_{p^n}$, but we don't really need that, right?}
There is some ring $L = L\left(E^*\right)$ (which depends on the spectrum $E$).
It is then possible define some generalized characters $\cl[n,p]{G; L}$, which are completely algebraic and combinatorial (besides the definition of the ring $L$).
Lastly, there is a character map $\chinpG: E^*\left(\BG\right) \to \cl[n,p]{G; L}$.
This character map has similar formal properties to the ordinary character map, namely, similarly to \ref{char-1}, after tensoring with $L$, the character map
$$
\chinpG \otimes L:
E^*\left(\BG\right) \otimes L
\to \cl[n,p]{G; L}
$$
becomes an isomorphism.
Similarly to \ref{char-2}, there is an action of $\aut\left(\ZZ_p^n\right) \cong \left(\ZZ_p^\times\right)^n$ on $\cl[n,p]{G; L}$, and it turns out that the character map lands in the fixed points.
Moreover, we can merely rationalize, which is given by inverting $p$, the source, rather tensoring with $L$.
It turns out that after rationalization and restricting the codomain to the fixed points, the map becomes an isomorphism, that is
$$
p^{-1} \chinpG:
p^{-1} E^*\left(\BG\right)
\to \cl[n,p]{G; L}^{\aut\left(\ZZ_p^n\right)}
$$
is an isomorphism.

\todo{write something about the structure of this section}



\subsection{Towards a Definition of the Character Map}

Following \cite{HKR}, we denote by $\Lambda_r = \left(\ZZ/{p^r}\right)^n$ and $\Lambda = \ZZ_p^n$.

An element $g \in G$ is called \emph{$p$-power-torsion} if $g^{p^a} = e$ for some $a$.
Note that a conjugation of a $p$-power-torsion element is again $p$-power-torsion.
We also define $r_0 \in \mbb{N}$ to be the minimal $r$ s.t. every $p$-power-torsion element $g$ is $p^{r_0}$-torsion, i.e. satisfies $g^{p^{r_0}} = e$.

Consider the set $\Gnp$ of $n$-tuples $\left(g_1, \dotsc, g_n\right)$ of commuting $p$-power-torsion elements.
This set has an action of $G$ by conjugating all the elements in a tuple by the same element, i.e. $\gamma \in G$ acts by $\gamma. \left(g_1, \dotsc, g_n\right) = \left(\gamma^{-1} g_1 \gamma, \dotsc, \gamma^{-1} g_n \gamma\right)$.
Concretely, for $r \geq r_0$, we have $\Gnp = \hom_{\Grp}\left(\Lambda_r, G\right)$, with the $G$-action by conjugation at the values.
In a similar fashion, $\Gnp = \hom_{\TopGrp}\left(\Lambda, G\right)$ (the homomorphisms are required to be continuous).

Let $R$ be a ring.
Equip it with the trivial $G$-action.
We define the class functions $\cl[n,p]{G; R} = \hom_{\GSet}\left(\Gnp, R\right)$, that is functions to $R$ which are invariant under the $G$ action.
This is a ring, by defining the operations point-wise.
Note that this is a purely algebraic/combinatorial construction, just a copy of $R$ for every orbit of $\Gnp/G$, that is $\cl[n,p]{G; R} \cong \bigoplus_{\left[\alpha\right] \in \Gnp/G} R$.

We would like to construct a character map $E^*\left(\BG\right) \to \cl[n,p]{G; R}$, for some $R$.
We will try to unravel what this means, and find appropriate $R$'s at the same time.
By the above, this is a homomorphism $E^*\left(\BG\right) \to \bigoplus_{\left[\alpha\right] \in \Gnp/G} R$.
That is, for every $\left[\alpha\right] \in \Gnp/G$ we need to provide a homomorphism $E^*\left(\BG\right) \to R$.
Choose a representative $\alpha \in \Gnp = \hom_{\Grp}\left(\Lambda_r, G\right)$ (for $r \geq r_0$).
Since $\BB$ is a functor we get $\BB[\alpha]: \BB[\Lambda_r] \to \BG$, and then we can take $E$-cohomology to get a homomorphism $\BB[\alpha]^*: E^*\left(\BG\right) \to E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right)$.
If we had a homomorphism $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right) \to R$, such that its composition with $\BB[\alpha]^*$ is independent of the choice of $r$ and $\alpha$, we would indeed get a well-defined character map.



\subsection{The \texorpdfstring{$E$}{E}-Cohomology of \texorpdfstring{$\BB[A]$}{BA}}

We postpone the discussion of the rings, to give some properties of $E$-cohomology.

First we wish to describe the $E^*\left(\BB[\ZZ/m]\right)$.
Let $\psi_m: \ZZ/m \to \UU[1]$ be the homomorphism $\psi\left(1\right) = e^{2\pi i/m}$
This induces $\BB\psi^*: E^*\left(\BU[1]\right) \to E^*\left(\BB[\ZZ/m]\right)$.
Denote by $x \in E^2\left(\BB[\ZZ/m]\right)$ the cohomology class $\BB\psi^*\left(x\right)$.

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[5.8]{HKR}}]
	The $E^*$-cohomology of $\BB[\ZZ/m]$ is given by $E^*\left(\BB[\ZZ/m]\right) = E^*\formal{x} / \left(\left[m\right]\left(x\right)\right)$.
	Write $m = sp^t$ with $a$ coprime to $p$, then this is a free $E^*$-module of rank $p^{nt}$.
\end{proposition}
\todo{I don't understand the proof, try to understand and write here}

\begin{proposition}
	Let $Y$ be a space s.t. $E^*\left(Y\right)$ is a free $E^*$-module of finite rank.
	Then $Y$ satisfies Kunneth with respect to any $X$, that is, the map $E^*\left(X\right) \otimes_{E_*} E^*\left(Y\right) \to E^*\left(X \times Y\right)$ is an isomorphism.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Look at the functors $X \mapsto E^*\left(X\right) \otimes E^*\left(Y\right)$ and $X \mapsto E^*\left(X \times Y\right)$.
	Both of them are manifestly homotopy invariant.
	Since $E^*\left(Y\right)$ is free, it is also flat, and so both functors satisfy Mayer-Vietoris.
	Both functors send arbitrary wedges to arbitrary products, since tensor with a free finite rank modules commutes with arbitrary products.
	We conclude that they are both cohomology theories.
	Moreover, they agree on $X = *$, and therefore are isomorphic.
\end{proof}

Using both propositions we can bootstrap to arbitrary finite abelian groups.

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[5.8]{HKR}}]
	Let $A$ be an abelian group, and write $\left|A\right| = sp^t$ for $s$ coprime to $p$.
	Then $E^*\left(\BB[A]\right)$ is a free $E^*$-module of rank $p^t$, and $\BB[A]$ satisfies Kunneth.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	A finite abelian group is the product of finite cyclic groups.
	Since $\BB$ commutes with products, we can induct on the number of components in the product.
\end{proof}

Moreover, for the specific case $\Lambda_r$ we also get a very explicit answer immediately by combining the results above.

\begin{proposition}\label{E-B-lambda-r}
	For $\Lambda_r = \left(\ZZ/{p^r}\right)^n$ we have:
	$$
	E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right)
	\cong \bigotimes_n E^*\formal{x}/\left(\left[p^r\right]\left(x\right)\right)
	\cong E^*\formal{x_1, \dotsc, x_n}/\left(\left[p^r\right]\left(x_1\right), \dotsc, \left[p^r\right]\left(x_n\right)\right).
	$$
\end{proposition}

Recall that the formal group law on $E_*$ was defined by taking the $E^*\left(\BB-\right)$ to the multiplication map $\UU[1] \times \UU[1] \to \UU[1]$.
By pre-composing with the diagonal, and doing this for $k$-copies of $\UU[1]$, we see that the multiplication-by-$k$ map $\UU[1] \overset{m}{\to} \UU[1]$ induces the map $E^*\formal{x} \to E^*\formal{x}$ given by $x \mapsto \left[k\right]\left(x\right)$.

Let $\varphi: \ZZ/m \to \ZZ/l$ be the homomorphism given by $1 \mapsto k$.
The composition $\psi_l \circ \varphi$ is given by $1 \mapsto e^{2\pi ik/l}$.
We then get the commutative diagram below by taking the upper arrow to be the multiplication-by-$k$ map.
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
	\UU[1] \arrow{r}{k} & \UU[1] \\
	\ZZ/m \arrow[hook]{u}{\psi_m} \arrow{r}{\varphi} & \ZZ/l \arrow[hook]{u}{\psi_l}
\end{tikzcd}
$$
By taking $E^*\left(\BB-\right)$ we get the commutative diagram:
$$
\begin{tikzcd}
	E^*\formal{x} \arrow{d}{x \mapsto x} & E^*\formal{x} \arrow{d}{x \mapsto x} \arrow{l}{[k]\left(x\right) \mapsfrom x} \\
	E^*\formal{x}/\left(\left[m\right]\left(x\right)\right) & E^*\formal{x}/\left(\left[l\right]\left(x\right)\right) \arrow{l}{}
\end{tikzcd}
$$
We then conclude:

\begin{proposition}\label{E-B-map-cyclic}
	The map $\varphi: \ZZ/m \to \ZZ/l$ given by $\varphi\left(1\right) = k$, after taking $E^*\left(\BB-\right)$, induces the map given by $x \mapsto [k]\left(x\right)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{remark}
	Note that the above proposition implies that the value of $[k]\left(x\right)$ in $E^*\formal{x}/\left(\left[m\right]\left(x\right)\right)$ is independent of the lift of $k$ from $\ZZ/l$ to $\ZZ$.
	\todo{is that true?}
\end{remark}



\subsection{The Rings \texorpdfstring{$L_r\left(E^*\right)$}{Lr(E*)} and \texorpdfstring{$L\left(E^*\right)$}{L(E*)}}

As we have seen, to construct the character map we needed a ring $R$ together with homomorphisms $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right) \to R$.

Recall that $E^*\left(\BU[1]\right) = E^*\formal{x}$, where $x$ is the complex orientation.
For any homomorphism $\alpha: \Lambda_r \to \UU[1]$, we can take $E^*\left(\BB-\right)$ to get $\BB[\alpha]^*: E^*\left(\UU[1]\right) \to E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right)$.
Let $S_r = \left\{ \BB[\alpha]^*\left(x\right) \mid \alpha: \Lambda_r \to \UU[1], \alpha \neq 1 \right\} \subseteq E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right)$.
We define $L_r = S_r^{-1} E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right)$.

Recall that $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right) \cong E^*\formal{x_1, \dotsc, x_n}/\left(\left[p^r\right]\left(x_1\right), \dotsc, \left[p^r\right]\left(x_n\right)\right)$ by \ref{E-B-lambda-r}.
Let $\Lambda_r \overset{\alpha}{\to} S^1$ be a homomorphism.
Since it lands in the $p^r$-torsion, it factors as $\Lambda_r \overset{\alpha}{\to} \ZZ/{p^r} \overset{\psi_{p^r}}{\to} \UU[1]$ (where we denoted the first morphism with $\alpha$ as well).
Note that a morphism $\Lambda_r \overset{\alpha}{\to} \ZZ/{p^r}$ is just a direct sum $\oplus \alpha_i$ for $\alpha_i: \ZZ/{p^r} \to \ZZ/{p^r}$, each of which is determined by $\alpha_i\left(1\right) = k_i$.
The condition $\alpha \neq 1$ amounts to the condition that $\left(k_1, \dotsc, k_n\right) \neq 0$.
By \ref{E-B-map-cyclic}, the map $\BB[\alpha_i]^*: E^*\formal{x}/\left(\left[p^r\right]\left(x\right)\right) \to E^*\formal{x_i}/\left(\left[p^r\right]\left(x_i\right)\right)$ is given by $x \mapsto [k_i]\left(x_i\right)$.
We conclude that $\BB[\alpha]^*\left(x\right) = [k_1]\left(x_1\right) + \cdots + [k_n]\left(x_n\right)$. \todo{explain more?}
Therefore $S_r = \left\{ [k_1]\left(x_1\right) + \cdots + [k_n]\left(x_n\right) \mid \left(k_1, \dotsc, k_n\right) \neq 0\right\}$.

The projections $\Lambda_{r+1} \to \Lambda_r$ induce maps $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right) \to E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_{r+1}]\right)$, given by $x_i \mapsto x_i$.
Now, any $[k_1]\left(x_1\right) + \cdots + [k_n]\left(x_n\right) \in S^r$ is mapped to $[k_1]\left(x_1\right) + \cdots + [k_n]\left(x_n\right) \in S^{r+1}$.
Therefore, once we invert $S^{r+1}$ in the target, all $S^r$ are mapped to units, so we get a map $L_r \to L_{r+1}$.
We define $L = L\left(E^*\right) = \colim L_r$.

Also, $E^*\left(\BB[\Lambda_r]\right)$ clearly has an $\aut\left(\Lambda_r\right)$ action.
Since $\aut\left(\Lambda_r\right) \cong \GL_n\left(\ZZ/{p^r}\right)$, an element is determined by an invertible matrix $\left(\alpha_{ij}\right)$.
By similar considerations to the above, the corresponding map acts by $x_i \mapsto \sum_j \left[\alpha_{ij}\right]\left(x_j\right)$.
Similarly, we see that $\sum_i [k_i]\left(x_i\right) \in S^r$ is mapped to $\sum_j \left[\sum_i  \alpha_{ij}k_i\right]\left(x_j\right)$. \todo{explain this}
Since $\left(k_1, \dotsc, k_n\right) \neq 0$ and the matrix is invertible, $\left(\sum \alpha_{i1} k_i, \dotsc, \sum \alpha_{in} k_i\right) \neq 0$, so the result is in $S^r$ as well.
This shows that action lifts to an action on $L_r$.

Moreover, the projection $\aut\left(\Lambda_{r+1}\right) \to \aut\left(\Lambda_r\right)$ gives a $\aut\left(\Lambda_{r+1}\right)$ action on $L_r$, and the map $L_r \to L_{r+1}$ is equivariant with respect to that action, by similar considerations. \todo{explain more?}
Since $L$ has a compatible $\aut\left(\Lambda_r\right)$ action for all $r$, we get an $\aut\left(\Lambda\right)$ action compatible with all of the $\aut\left(\Lambda_r\right)$ actions.
