\section{Overview of Chromatic Homotopy Theory}

Our goal is to motivate the introduction of Morava K-theory $\K[n]$ and Morava E-theory $\E{n}$, and other variants of Morava E-theory $\E{k,\Gamma}$, and their connection to formal group laws.
There are different views on what chromatic homotopy theory is.

\subsection{The Balmer Spectrum}

We will start with an algebraic motivation.
Let $R$ be a noetherian ring.
Consider the symmetric monoidal stable $\infty$-category $\Ch{R}$ of chain complexes on $R$. \todo{be more specific}
It is then natural to ask how much information about $R$ is encoded in the category $\Ch{R}$.
We will try to recover $\spec R$, as a topological space, from $\Ch{R}$.

\begin{remark}
	Balmer's work actually recovers the structure sheaf as well. \todo{reference}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
	A \emph{perfect complex} is a complex that is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex of finitely-generated projective modules.
	These objects are the compact objects in $\Ch{R}$, thus they can be defined categorically.
	Their full subcategory is denoted by $\Chperf{R}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	Let $\mcl{C}$ be some symmetric monoidal stable $\infty$-category.
	A full subcategory $\mcl{T}$ is \emph{thick} if:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $0 \in \mcl{T}$,
		\item it is closed under cofibers (that is if $a \to b \to c$ is a cofiber sequence in $\mcl{C}$ and $a, b \in \mcl{T}$, then $c \in \mcl{T}$),
		\item it is closed under retracts.
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	Consider the case $\mcl{C} = \Chperf{R}$ (e.g. over $\ZZ$, bounded chain complexes of finitely-generated free abelian groups).
	Let $K_\bullet \in \Ch{R}$, and define
	$\mcl{T}_{K_\bullet} = \left\{ A_\bullet \in \Chperf{R} \mid A_\bullet \otimes K_\bullet = 0 \right\}$.
	We claim that $\mcl{T}_{K_\bullet}$ is thick.
	Clearly $0 \in \mcl{T}_{K_\bullet}$.
	Let $A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ be a morphism between two complexes in $\mcl{T}$. The cofiber of $A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ is the pushout $B_\bullet \times_{A_\bullet} 0$. Since tensor is left, tensoring the cofiber with $K_\bullet$ is given by the pushout
	$\left(B_\bullet \otimes K_\bullet\right) \times_{A_\bullet \otimes K_\bullet} \left(0 \otimes K_\bullet\right) = 0 \times_0 0 = 0$, therefore the cofiber is indeed in $\mcl{T}$.
	Lastly, if $A_\bullet \to B_\bullet \to A_\bullet$ is the identity and $B_\bullet \otimes K_\bullet$, we get that $\id{A_\bullet \otimes K_\bullet}$ factors through $0$, which implies that $A_\bullet \otimes K_\bullet$ is $0$, so that $A_\bullet \in \mcl{T}$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
	A thick subcategory $\mcl{T}$ is an \emph{ideal} if $a \in \mcl{T}, b \in \mcl{C} \implies a \otimes b \in \mcl{T}$.
	Furthermore, it is a \emph{prime ideal} if it is a proper subcategory, and $a \otimes b \in \mcl{T} \implies a \in \mcl{T} \textrm{ or } b \in \mcl{T}$.
	The \emph{spectrum} of the category is defined similarly to the classical spectrum of a ring:
	As a set, $\spec \mcl{C} = \left\{ \mcl{P}\textrm{ prime ideal} \right\}$.
	For any family of objects $S \subseteq \mcl{C}$ we define $V\left(S\right) = \left\{ \mcl{P} \in \spec \mcl{C} \mid S \cap \mcl{P} = \emptyset \right\}$.
	We topologize $\spec \mcl{C}$ with the Zariski topology by declaring those to be the closed subsets.
	We also denote $\supp\left(a\right) = V\left(\left\{ a\right\}\right)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	We continue the example of $\mcl{T}_{K_\bullet}$.
	Clearly if $A_\bullet \otimes K_\bullet = 0$ then also $A_\bullet \otimes B_\bullet \otimes K_\bullet = 0$, so it is an ideal.
	Let $\mfk{p}$ be a prime ideal in $R$ in the usual sense, and take $K_\bullet = R_\mfk{p}$ (concentrated at degree $0$),
	then $A_\bullet \otimes K_\bullet = \left(A_\bullet\right)_\mfk{p}$ (level-wise localization).
	Now, assume that
	$
	0
	= \left(A_\bullet \otimes B_\bullet\right)_\mfk{p}
	= \left(A_\bullet\right)_\mfk{p} \otimes_{R_\mfk{p}} \left(B_\bullet\right)_\mfk{p}
	$
	Assume by negation that $\left(A_\bullet\right)_\mfk{p}, \left(B_\bullet\right)_\mfk{p} \neq 0$,
	i.e. $\left(A_n\right)_\mfk{p}, \left(B_m\right)_\mfk{p} \neq 0$ but $\left(A_n\right)_\mfk{p} \otimes_{R_\mfk{p}} \left(B_m\right)_\mfk{p} = 0$ for some $n,m$.
	Well, localization of projective is projective, and a projective over a local ring is free, and clearly if the tensor of two free modules vanish then one of them vanishes, so $\left(A_n\right)_\mfk{p} = 0$ or $\left(B_m\right)_\mfk{p} = 0$, which is a contradiction.
	Therefore $\mcl{T}_\mfk{p}$ is a prime ideal.
\end{example}

\begin{theorem}
	The map $\spec R \to \spec\left(\Chperf{R}\right)$,
	given by $\mfk{p} \mapsto \mcl{T}_\mfk{p} = \left\{ A_\bullet \mid \left(A_\bullet\right)_\mfk{p} = 0 \right\}$
	is a homeomorphism.
\end{theorem}
\todo{reference}

\begin{proposition}\label{primes-pullback}
	Prime ideals pullback:
	Let $F: \mcl{C} \to \mcl{D}$ be a reduced symmetric monoidal functor that preserves cofibers, between two symmetric monoidal stable $\infty$-categories,
	and let $\mcl{P}$ be a prime ideal in $\mcl{D}$, then $F^*\mcl{P} = \left\{ a \in \mcl{C} \mid F\left(a\right) \in \mcl{P} \right\}$ is a prime ideal.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Clearly $F\left(0\right) = 0 \in \mcl{P}$ since $F$ is reduced, so $0 \in F^*\mcl{P}$.
	Since $F$ preserves cofibers, for $a,b \in F^*\mcl{P}$, i.e. $F\left(a\right), F\left(b\right) \in \mcl{P}$, and a map $a \to b$ we get
	$
	F\left(\cofib\left(a \to b\right)\right)
	= \cofib\left(F\left(a\right) \to F\left(b\right)\right)
	= \cofib\left(F\left(a\right) \to F\left(b\right)\right)
	\in \mcl{P}
	$.
	Let $a \to b \to a$ be a retract, that is the composition is the identity, s.t. $b \in F^*\mcl{P}$. We know that $F\left(a\right) \to F\left(b\right) \to F\left(a\right)$ is also a retract by functoriality, thus $F\left(a\right) \in \mcl{P}$, that is $a \in F^*\mcl{P}$.
	We conclude that $F^*\mcl{P}$ is indeed a thick subcategory.
	
	Let $a \in F^*\mcl{P}, b \in \mcl{C}$, since $F$ is monoidal, $F\left(a \otimes b\right) = F\left(a\right) \otimes F\left(b\right) \in \mcl{P}$, so $a \otimes b \in F^*\mcl{P}$, that is $F^*\mcl{P}$ is an ideal.
	
	Lastly, assume that $a \otimes b \in F^*\mcl{P}$, again since $F$ is monoidal, $F\left(a \otimes b\right) = F\left(a\right) \otimes F\left(b\right) \in \mcl{P}$, so $a \in F^*\mcl{P}$ or $b \in F^*\mcl{P}$, that is $F^*\mcl{P}$ is a prime ideal.
\end{proof}

Now, recall that $\Ch{R} \cong \Mod{\HH{R}}$, therefore we can reinterpret the above theorem as $\spec R \cong \spec\left( \Mod{\HH{R}}^\mrm{comp} \right)$ (where the $\mrm{comp}$ denotes the compact objects in the category).
We shall turn this theorem into a definition:

\begin{definition}
	Let $R$ be an $\mbb{E}_\infty$-ring.
	We define the \emph{spectrum} of $R$ to be
	$\spec R = \spec\left( \Mod{R}^\mrm{comp} \right)$.
\end{definition}

A natural question to ask then is what is $\spec \SS$.
Recall that $\Mod{\SS} = \Sp$, the category of spectra, and that the compact objects in spectra are the finite spectra $\Spfin$.
So, unwinding the definitions, the question can rephrased as finding the prime ideals in $\Spfin$, and their topology.
Chromatic homotopy theory provides an answer to this question.



\subsection{$\MU$ and Complex Orientations}

Throughout this section, let $E$ be a multiplicative cohomology theory (that is, equipped with a map $E \otimes E \to E$ which is associative and unital up to homotopy).

Consider the map $S^2 \to \BU[1]$ classifying the universal complex line bundle.
Concretely, under the identifications $S^2 \cong \CP{1}$ and $\BU[1] \cong \CP{\infty}$, this map can be realized as the inclusion $\CP{1} \subseteq \CP{\infty}$.
This map induces a map
$
\tilde{E}^2\left(\BU[1]\right)
\to \tilde{E}^2\left(S^2\right)
\cong \tilde{E}^0\left(S^0\right)
\cong E^0\left(*\right)
= E_0
$.
Since $E$ is unital, there is a canonical generator $1 \in E_0$.

\begin{definition}
	$E$ is called \emph{complex oriented} if the map $\tilde{E}^2\left(\BU[1]\right) \to E_0$ is surjective, equivalently, if $1$ is in the image of that map.
	A choice of a lift $x \in \tilde{E}^2\left(\BU[1]\right)$ of $1 \in E_0$ is called a \emph{complex orientation}.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	Let $R$ be some ring, and consider $\HH{R}$.
	It is known that
	$\HH{R}^*\left(\CP{n}\right) \cong R \left[x\right] / \left(x^{n+1}\right)$
	and
	$\HH{R}^*\left(\CP{\infty}\right) \cong R \left[\left[x\right]\right]$,
	where $\left|x\right| = 2$,
	and the maps induced by the inclusions of projective spaces maps $x$ to $x$.
	Therefore we see that $x \in \HH{R}^2\left(\BU[1]\right)$ is mapped to $x \in \HH{R}^2\left(S^2\right) = \ZZ\left\{x\right\}$, which is mapped to the generator of the reduced part of $\HH{R}^0\left(S^0\right) = R \oplus R$.
	Therefore $x$ is a complex orientation for $\HH{R}$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Let $\K$ be complex K-theory, then we know that $\K_* = \ZZ\left[\beta^{\pm 1}\right]$ where $\beta$ is the Bott element, with $\left|\beta\right| = 2$.
	It is also known (by Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence) that
	$\K^*\left(\CP{n}\right) \cong \K_* \left[t\right] / \left(t^{n+1}\right)$
	and
	$\K^*\left(\CP{\infty}\right) \cong \K_* \left[\left[t\right]\right]$
	(here $\left|t\right| = 0$),
	where the maps induced by the inclusions of projective spaces maps $t$ to $t$.
	We deduce that $\beta t \in \K^2\left(\BU[1]\right)$ is mapped to $\beta t \in \K^2\left(S^2\right) = \ZZ\left\{\beta t\right\}$, which is mapped to $t \in \K^0\left(S^0\right) = \ZZ\left\{t\right\}$, which is indeed the generator of the reduced part.
	Therefore $x = \beta t$ is complex orientation for $\K$.
	\todo{write the reduced thing more clearly}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	Recall that $\MU$ is constructed as the colimit $\MU = \colim \MU[n]$.
	Also, $\MU[1] \cong \Sigma^{\infty-2} \BU[1]$.
	Therefore we get a canonical map $\Sigma^{\infty-2} \BU[1] \to \MU$, which gives a cohomology class $x_{\MU} \in \MU^2\left(\BU[1]\right)$.
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}[\todo{reference}]
	$x_{\MU}$ is indeed a complex orientation for $\MU$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}
	$\MU$ is the universal complex oriented cohomology theory:
	Let $E$ be a multiplicative cohomology theory, then there is a bijection between (homotopy classes of) multiplicative maps $\MU \to E$ and complex orientations on $E$.
	The bijection is given in one direction by pulling back $x_{\MU}$ along a multiplicative map.
\end{theorem}

Assume that $E$ is complex oriented with a complex orientation $x$.

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[4.1.4]{Rav86}}]
	As $E_*$-algebras,
	$E^*\left(\BU[1]\right) \cong E^*\left[\left[x\right]\right]$
	and
	$E^*\left(\BU[1] \times \BU[1]\right) \cong E^*\left[\left[y,z\right]\right]$.
\end{theorem}
\todo{maybe indicate the use of AHSS}

The tensor product of complex line bundles is classified by a universal map $\BU[1] \times \BU[1] \to \BU[1]$.
Therefore we get a map $E^*\left(\BU[1]\right) \to E^*\left(\BU[1] \times \BU[1]\right)$, which is completely determined by the image of $x \in E^*\left[\left[x\right]\right]$ in $E^*\left[\left[y,z\right]\right]$ as above.
Therefore, a choice of a complex orientation on $E$ gives rise to an element $F_E\left(y,z\right) \in E^*\left[\left[y,z\right]\right]$.

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[4.1.4]{Rav86}}]
	$F_E$ is a formal group law on $E_*$.
	We call the height of $F_E$ the \emph{height} of $E$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{example}
	Consider again $\HH{R}$.
	It is known that the tensor of complex line bundles induces the map
	$
	R\left[\left[x\right]\right]
	= \HH{R}^*\left(\BU[1]\right)
	\to \HH{R}^*\left(\BU[1] \times \BU[1]\right)
	= R\left[\left[y,z\right]\right]
	$
	given by $x \mapsto y + z$.
	This is the additive formal group law.
	It is immediate that $\left[p\right] = p x$.
	So for $R = \mbb{Q}$ we get that the height of $\HH{\mbb{Q}}$ is 0, while for $R = \mbb{F}_p$ we have $p x = 0$ so the height of $\HH{\mbb{F}_p}$ is $\infty$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	We return to the example of complex $\K$-theory.
	It is known that the tensor of complex line bundles induces the map
	$
	\K_*\left[\left[t\right]\right]
	= \K^*\left(\BU[1]\right)
	\to \K^*\left(\BU[1] \times \BU[1]\right)
	= \K_*\left[\left[u,v\right]\right]
	$
	given by $t \mapsto u + v + u v$.
	Note that to comply with the definition of the formal group law, we should use the isomorphism
	$\K^*\left(\BU[1]\right) \cong \K_* \left[\left[x\right]\right]$,
	i.e. the element $x = \beta t$.
	We get that $x = \beta t \mapsto \beta u + \beta v + \beta u v = y + z + \beta^{-1} y z = F_{\K}\left(y,z\right)$.
	By induction we prove that the $n$-series is $\left[n\right]\left(x\right) = \beta \left(1 + \beta^{-1} x\right)^n - \beta$.
	This is clear for $n = 1$, and we have:
	\begin{align*} 
		\left[n+1\right]\left(x\right)
		&= x + \left[n\right]\left(x\right) + \beta^{-1} x \left[n\right]\left(x\right)\\
		&= x + \beta \left(1 + \beta^{-1} x\right)^n - \beta + x \left(1 + \beta^{-1} x\right)^n - x\\
		&= \beta \left(1 + \beta^{-1} x\right) \left(1 + \beta^{-1} x\right)^n - \beta\\
		&= \beta \left(1 + \beta^{-1} x\right)^{n+1} - \beta
	\end{align*}
\end{example}

\begin{example}
	By taking the cofiber of the multiplication-by-$p$ map, we get a spectrum $\K/p$, mod-$p$ K-theory, with coefficients $\left(\K/p\right)_* = \mathbb{F}_p \left[\beta^{\pm 1}\right]$.
	It is evident that $F_{\K/p}\left(y,z\right) = y + z + \beta^{-1} y z$ as well.
	From the result above, it follows that
	$
	\left[p\right]\left(x\right)
	= \beta \left(1 + \beta^{-1} x\right)^p - \beta
	= \beta \left(1^p + \beta^{-p} x^p\right) - \beta
	= \beta^{-p} x^p
	$
	which shows that the height is exactly $1$.
\end{example}

A formal group law on $E_*$ is the same data as a map from the Lazard ring $L$, so the complex orientation gives a map $L \to E_*$.
In particular, since $\MU$ is complex oriented, there is a canonical map $L \to \MU_*$.

\begin{theorem}[{Quillen, \cite[4.1.6]{Rav86}}]\label{quillen-theorem}
	The canonical map $L \to \MU_*$ is an isomorphism.
\end{theorem}



\subsection{$\BP$, Morava K-Theory and Morava E-Theory}

A good principle in homotopy theory (and many other areas in math) is to do study it one prime at a time.
This is possible in homotopy theory due to the arithmetic square \todo{reference}.
So, let us fix a prime $p$.
It turns out that once we $p$-localize $\MU$ to $\MU_{\left(p\right)}$, it splits:

\begin{theorem}[{\cite[4.1.12]{Rav86}}]
	There exists an associative commutative ring spectrum $\BP$ (which depends on the prime $p$), which is a retract of $\MU_{\left(p\right)}$.
	The homotopy groups of $\BP$ are $\BP_* = \ZZ_{\left(p\right)}\left[v_1, v_2, \dotsc\right]$ where $\left|v_n\right| = 2\left(p^n-1\right)$.
\end{theorem}

For convenience we denote $v_0 = p$ (and indeed $\left|v_0\right| = 2\left(p^0-1\right) = 0$).
Since $\BP$ is a retract of $\MU$ it comes with a map $\MU \to \BP$, that is a complex orientation.

\begin{proposition}[\todo{reference}]
	The $p$-series of the formal group law associated to $\BP$ is
	$\left[p\right]\left(x\right) = \sum v_n x^{p^n}$.
\end{proposition}

Once we have $\BP$, we can turn to the definition of Morava K-theory and Morava E-theory

\begin{definition}
	Let $0 < n < \infty$.
	\emph{Morava K-theory} at height $n$ and prime $p$, denoted by $\K[p,n]$ or $\K[n]$ when the prime is clear, is the spectrum obtained by killing $p=v_0, \dotsc, v_{n-1}, v_{n+1}, \dotsc$ in $\BP$ and inverting $v_n$.
	Therefore $\K[n]_* = \mbb{F}_p\left[v_n^{\pm 1}\right]$.
	We also define $\K[0] = \HH{\mbb{Q}}$ and $\K[\infty] = \HH{\mbb{F}_p}$.
	Similarly, \emph{Morava E-theory} at height $n$ and prime $p$, denoted by $\E{p,n}$ or $\E{n}$, is the spectrum obtained by killing $v_{n+1}, v_{n+2}, \dotsc$ in $\BP$ and inverting $v_n$.
	Therefore $\E{n}_* = \ZZ_{\left(p\right)}\left[v_1, v_2, \dotsc v_{n-1}, v_n^{\pm 1}\right]$.
\end{definition}

Since Morava K-theory and E-theory are obtained from $\BP$ by cofibers and filtered colimits, they are equipped with a map from $\BP$, so they are also equipped with a complex orientation.
It is then evident that the $p$-series associated to the formal group laws of $\K[n]$ and $\E{n}$ are $v_n x^{p^n}$ and $v_0 x + \dotsc v_n x^{p^n}$ respectively, and are therefore of height exactly $n$ and height $\leq n$ respectively.
(Note that by the example of $\HH{R}$, this is also true for $\K[0]$ and $\K[\infty]$.)

We want to describe some properties of Morava K-theory.
To do so we first need some definitions.

\begin{definition}
	Let $R$ be an evenly graded ring.
	$R$ is called a \emph{graded field} if every non-zero homogenus element is invertible, equivalently it is a field $F$ concentrated at degree 0, or $F\left[\beta^{\pm1}\right]$ for $\beta$ of positive even degree.
	An $\mbb{A}_\infty$-ring $E$ is a \emph{field} if $E_*$ is a graded field.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
	Clearly $K\left(n\right)$ for $0 \leq n \leq \infty$ is a field.
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}
	A field $E$ is has Kunneth, i.e. $E_*\left(X\otimes Y\right)\cong E_*\left(X\right)\otimes_{E_*}E_*\left(Y\right)$ for any spectra X,Y.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[24]{Lur}}]
	Let $E \neq 0$ be a complex oriented cohomology theory, whose formal group law has height exactly $n$, then $E \otimes \K[n] \neq 0$.
	Let $E$ be a field s.t. $E \otimes \K[n] \neq 0$, then $E$ admits the structure of a $\K[n]$-module.
	(Here $0 \leq n \leq \infty$.)
\end{proposition}

\begin{example}
	As we have seen before mod-$p$ K-theory, $\K/p$, has height exactly $1$ and coefficients $\left(\K/p\right)_* = \mathbb{F}_p \left[\beta^{\pm 1}\right]$.
	It is also known that $\K$, and $\K/p$, are $A_\infty$ ring spectra, from which it follows that $\K/p$ is a field.
	Therefore, we deduce that $\K/p$ is a $\K[1]$-module.
	Since $\left|\beta\right| = 2$ and $\left|v_1\right| = 2\left(p-1\right)$ it is free of rank $p-1$.
\end{example}

From this we also deduce some form of uniqueness for Morava K-theory:

\begin{corollary}
	Let $E$ be a field with $E_* \cong \mbb{F}_p\left[v_n^{\pm 1}\right]$, which is also complex oriented with height exactly $n$, then $E \cong \K[n]$ (as spectra).
\end{corollary}



\subsection{$\spec \SS_{\left(p\right)}$ and $\spec \SS$}

We are now in a position to state the answer for $\spec \SS$.
However, it will be easier to state it first for $\spec \SS_{\left(p\right)}$, and then pullback prime ideals.
We know that $\Mod{\SS_{\left(p\right)}} = \Sp_{\left(p\right)}$, and the compact objects there are $\Spfin_{\left(p\right)}$, the $p$-localizations of finite spectra.

\begin{proposition}
	Let
	$
	\mcl{T}_E
	= \ker E_*
	= \left\{ X \in \Spfin_{\left(p\right)} \mid E_{*}\left(X\right)=0 \right\}$
	(equivalently $X \otimes E = 0$) i.e. the $E$-acyclics, then $\mcl{T}_E$ is thick.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	The exact same proof from $\Chperf{R}$ works.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	We define $\mcl{C}_{p, n} = \mcl{T}_{\K[n]}$, the $\K[n]$-acyclics.
	By the above it is thick.
	Also, $\mcl{C}_{p, \infty} = \left\{ 0\right\}$ , which are trivially thick.
	When the prime is clear, we will denote by $\mcl{C}_n$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[{\cite[26]{Lur}}]
	For $X \in \Spfin_{\left(p\right)}$, if $\K[n]_{*}\left(X\right) = 0$ then $\K[n-1]_*\left(X\right) = 0$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}
	We say that a spectrum $X \in \Spfin_{\left(p\right)}$ is of \emph{type} $n$ (possibly $\infty$), if its first non-zero Morava K-theory homology is $\K[n]$.
\end{definition}

\begin{corollary}
	$\mcl{C}_n$ is the full subcategory of finite $p$-local spectra of type $> n$ (i.e. $\left\{ X \in \Spfin_{\left(p\right)} \mid \forall m \leq n: \K[m]_*\left(X\right) = 0 \right\}$).
	Thus clearly $\mcl{C}_{n+1} \subseteq \mcl{C}_n$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}[\todo{reference}]
	The inclusions are proper $\mcl{C}_{n+1} \subsetneq \mcl{C}_n$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proposition}
	If $X \in \Spfin_{\left(p\right)}$ is not contractible, then $X$ has a finite type.
	Therefore $\bigcap_{n < \infty} \mcl{C}_n = \left\{0\right\} = \mcl{C}_\infty$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	Let $X$ be non-contractible.
	Then $\HH{\ZZ}_*\left(X\right) \neq 0$.
	Let $m$ be the first non-zero degree.
	Using the universal coefficient theorem and the fact that the spectrum is $p$-local we get that $\left(\HH{\mbb{F}_p}\right)_m\left(X\right) \neq 0$, thus $\left(\HH{\mbb{F}_p}\right)_*\left(X\right) \neq 0$.
	Since $X$ is finite, $\left(\HH{\mbb{F}_p}\right)_*\left(X\right)$ is bounded.
	Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence for $X$ with cohomology $\K[n]$ has $E^2$-page given by
	$
	E_{p,q}^2
	= 
	H_p\left(X; \K[n]_q(*)\right)
	$.
	Since $\K[n]_q = \mbb{F}_p$ for $q = 0 \mod 2\left(p^n-1\right)$ and $0$ otherwise,
	we see that the rows $q = 0 \mod 2\left(p^n-1\right)$ are $\left(\HH{\mbb{F}_p}\right)_*\left(X\right)$, and the others are $0$.
	Therefore if we take $n$ such that the period $2\left(p^n-1\right)$ is larger then the bound on $\left(\HH{\mbb{F}_p}\right)_*\left(X\right)$, then all differentials have either source or target $0$.
	Thus, the spectral sequence collapses at the $E^2$-page, and since $\left(\HH{\mbb{F}_p}\right)_*\left(X\right) \neq 0$, we ge that $\K[n]\left(X\right) \neq 0$, i.e. $X$ has type $<n$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	$\mcl{C}_n$ is a prime ideal.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
	For X,Y by Kunneth we have $\K[n-1]_*\left(X \otimes  Y\right) = \K[n-1]_*\left(X\right) \otimes \K[n-1]_*\left(Y\right)$.
	Therefore, if $X \in \mcl{C}_n$, i.e. the homology vanishes, then so does the homology of $X \otimes Y$, i.e. $X \otimes Y \in \mcl{C}_n$, so $\mcl{C}_n$ is an ideal.
	If $X \otimes Y\in \mcl{C}_n$ then the homology of the product vanishes, therefore one in the right side must vanish (they are graded vector spaces), so $\mcl{C}_n$ is a prime ideal.
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}[Thick Subcategory Theorem \cite{HS}]
	If $\mcl{T}$ is a proper thick subcategory of $\Spfin_{\left(p\right)}$, then $\mcl{T} = \mcl{C}_n$ for some $0 \leq n \leq \infty$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
	The proof relies on a major theorem called the Nilpotence Theorem.
\end{remark}

\begin{corollary}
	$\spec \SS_{\left(p\right)} = \left\{ \mcl{C}_0, \mcl{C}_1, \dotsc, \mcl{C}_\infty \right\}$,
	and the topology is such that the closed subsets are chains
	$\left\{ \mcl{C}_k, \mcl{C}_{k+1}, \dotsc, \mcl{C}_\infty \right\}$
	for some $0 \leq k \leq \infty$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}
	Follows immediately from the previous results.
\end{proof}

We now want to move to finding $\spec \SS$.
Note that the $p$-localization functor $L_{\left(p\right)}$ is a Bousfield localization.
As such it is left (its right adjoint is the inclusion), and in particular preserves cofibers.
It also clearly sends $0$ to $0$, i.e. reduced.
Now, since $L_{\left(p\right)}$ is smashing, i.e. $L_{\left(p\right)} X = X \otimes \SS_{\left(p\right)}$, we also get that it is symmetric monoidal.
As we have seen in \ref{primes-pullback}, under these conditions we can pullback primes.
Therefore
$
\mcl{P}_{p, n}
= L_{\left(p\right)}^* \mcl{C}_{p, n}
= \left\{
	X \in \Spfin
	\mid
	\K[n]_*\left(X_{\left(p\right)}\right) = 0
\right\}
$
and
$
\mcl{P}_{p, \infty}
= L_{\left(p\right)}^* \mcl{C}_{p, \infty}
= \left\{
	X \in \Spfin
	\mid
	X_{\left(p\right)} = 0
\right\}
$
are prime ideals.
Note that
$
\mcl{P}_{p, 0}
= \left\{
	X \in \Spfin
	\mid
	{\HH{\mbb{Q}}}_*\left(X_{\left(p\right)}\right) = 0
\right\}
= \left\{
	X \in \Spfin
	\mid
	{\HH{\mbb{Q}}}_*\left(X\right) = 0
\right\}
$
\todo{explain}
so it is independent of $p$, and we will denote it by $\Spfintor$.

\begin{theorem}[\todo{explain/reference}]
	$
	\spec \SS
	= \left\{\Spfintor\right\}
	\cup \bigcup_p \left\{\mcl{P}_{p, 1}, \dotsc, \mcl{P}_{p, \infty}\right\}
	$,
	and the topology is such that the closed subsets finite unioins of chains
	$\left\{ \mcl{P}_{p, k}, \mcl{P}_{p, k+1}, \dotsc, \mcl{P}_{p, \infty} \right\}$
	for some $0 \leq k \leq \infty$ (i.e. they may include $\Spfintor$).

\subsection{The Stacky Point of View and the Relationship Between Morava K-Theory and Morava E-Theory}

First we will describe, without being precise, another point of view on what chromatic homotopy theory is about.

There is a stack of formal groups, denoted by $\Mfg$.
It can be described as the stack that sends a ring $R$ to the groupoid of formal group laws, with isomorphisms between them.
Quillen theorem \ref{quillen-theorem} tells us that $\MU_*$ is the Lazard ring, that is the universal ring that carries the universal formal group law.
It turns out that this theorem has a second part, which says that $\left(\MU \otimes \MU\right)_*$ is the universal ring that carries two formal group laws and an isomorphism between them.
Therefore, $\Mfg$ is represented by $\left(\MU_*, \left(\MU \otimes \MU\right)_*\right)$.

The geometric points of the stack $\Mfg$ are describe precisely the same as $\spec \SS$, that is because for an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$ there is a unique (up to isomorphism) formal group law which is of height $0$ namely the additive formal group law, and for characteristic $p$ there is a unique (up to isomorphism) formal group law of each height $1 \leq n \leq \infty$.

For a spectrum $X$, $\MU_*\left(X\right)$ is a $\left(\MU_*, \left(\MU \otimes \MU\right)_*\right)$-comodule, which is the same as a sheaf over $\Mfg$.
From this point of view, chromatic homotopy theory lets us study a spectrum by decomposing it over the stack $\Mfg$.

We can restrict ourselves to the stack only over rings of characteristic $p$, $\Mfgp$, which is then represented by $\left(\left(\MU_{\left(p\right)}\right)_*, \left(\MU_{\left(p\right)} \otimes \MU_{\left(p\right)}\right)_*\right)$. \todo{I think it's true, is it?}
Similarly to $\MU$, $\BP$ is universal ring with the universal $p$-typical formal group law, and $\left(\BP \otimes \BP\right)_*$ is the universal ring with two $p$-typical formal group laws and an isomorphism between them \todo{I didn't say this before}.
Since every formal group law is isomorphic to a $p$-typical one, we know that the stack $\Mfgp$ is also represented by $\left(\BP_*, \left(\BP \otimes \BP\right)_*\right)$.

It is now reasonable that $\K[n]$, obtained from $\BP$ by killing the $v_m$'s for $m \neq n$ and inverting $v_n$, sees the $n$-th level, and that $\E{n}$ obtained in the same way but only killing $v_m$ for $m > n$, sees the levels $\leq n$.
\todo{I didn't interpret the $v_n$'s before as coefficients in the $p$-series which determines the height}

Let us now claim a precise statement, formalizing this description.

\begin{theorem}[\todo{reference}]
	$\E{n}$ and $\K[0] \oplus \cdots \oplus \K[n]$ are Bousfield equivalent.
	That is, they have the same acyclics, locals, and their localization functors are the same.
\end{theorem}

\todo{chromatic square and chromatic tower, maybe another subsection?}



\subsection{Landweber Exact Functor Theorem and Deformation Theory}

As we have seen, a complex orientation on a cohomology theory, which is described by a map $\MU \to E$, has an associated formal group law, which is described by the map $L = \MU_* \to E_*$.
One can ask whether the converse is true, namely given a ring $R$ and a formal group law $F$ given by $L \to R$, is there a complex oriented cohomology theory whose coefficients are $R$ and the associated formal group law is $F$.

A strategy is to define $E_{R,F}\left(X\right) = \MU\left(X\right) \otimes_{\MU_*} R$.
Unfortunately, this is not always a homology theory.
However there is a condition which one can check which guarantees that it is.

\begin{definition}
	$R$ is called \emph{Landweber flat} if for every prime $p$, the sequence $p = v_0, v_1, v_2, \dotsc$ is regular,
	that is, for each $n$, $v_n$ is not a zero divisor in $R/\left(v_0, v_1, \dotsc, v_{n-1}\right)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Landweber Exact Functor Theorem (LEFT) \todo{reference}]
	If $R$ is Landweber flat, then $E_{R,F}$ defined above is a homology theory.
	Moreover, there are no phantom maps between such spectra, so $E_{R,F}$ is represented by a spectrum.
	This spectrum is complex oriented, has coefficients $R$ and associated formal group law $F$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{example}
	Morava E-theory is Landweber flat.
	Morava K-theory and $\HH{\ZZ}$ are not.
	\todo{elaborate? reference?}
\end{example}

The Morava E-theory we have considered until now $\E[n]$, also called Johnson-Wilson spectrum was constructed from $\BP$.
As we noted, it is Landweber flat, which indicated that there is another approach to constructing it.
Indeed there is such a way, which will be called the Lubin-Tate spectrum.

Let $k$ be a perfect field of characteristic $p$ (i.e. the Frobenius is an isomorphism), and $\Gamma$ a formal group law over $k$.
